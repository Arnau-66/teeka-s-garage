# 🛠️ Teeka's Garage

**Teeka's Garage** is a learning project built with **Angular** that consumes the **Star Wars API (SWAPI)** to display a list of starships and their details.  
It’s part of a technical exercise inspired by a real front-end developer test from an e-commerce company in Barcelona.  
The goal is to practice **API integration**, **routing**, **services**, **authentication**, and **clean architecture** while exploring the Star Wars universe 🚀✨.

## 📖 Project Overview

**Teeka's Garage** recreates the atmosphere of **Tatooine’s starship shop**, run by the famous Jawa **Teeka** from Star Wars.  
This theme is used to structure and present the different required parts of the **IT Academy Barcelona – Sprint 7** exercise.  

The sprint requested the following key elements:

- 🏠 A **Home menu**  
- 🔐 A **Login page** with **name and email validation**, using a Firebase database as backend  
- 🚀 A **main page** displaying a **list of starships**, fetched from the **Star Wars API**  
- 📄 A **detail page** showing the **specifications of a selected starship**, using the same API  

Teeka's Garage implements all these points through an immersive Star Wars–themed interface:

- 🌍 **Home:** A preview of **Tatooine** acts as the entry screen to the experience.  
- 🛑 **Login:** Styled as an **Imperial control checkpoint**, where users enter their credentials.  
- 🛠️ **Starships Page:** Teeka welcomes you to her shop and presents a **holographic catalog** of starships.  
- 📋 **Starship Details Page:** Teeka uses her **data pad** to show the full specs of the selected ship.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

- **Angular 20.3.4** (standalone components, SCSS)  
- **Firebase** – For user data and login validation  
- **SWAPI – Star Wars API**  
- **Star Wars Visual Guide** – Image assets  
- **Postman** – API testing tool  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration  
- **Node.js & npm** – Package management & Angular CLI

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally from scratch:

### 1. 📦 Install Node.js and Angular CLI

- **Check Node.js**  
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
  Make sure you have Node.js LTS (≥ 18.x) and npm installed.

- **Install Angular CLI globally**  
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ```

- **Verify Angular CLI**  
  ```bash
  ng version
  ```

---

### 2. ⬇️ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

> ⚠️ If your local folder name differs from the repo name, adjust the `cd` command accordingly.

---

### 3. 📥 Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will download all the required Node modules for the Angular project.

---

### 4. 🧪 Start the development server

```bash
ng serve
```

Then open http://localhost:4200 in your browser.

The server will **automatically reload** when you change any source file.

---

### 5. 🧱 Build for production

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.  
You can serve them with any static server, for example:

```bash
npx http-server dist/<project-folder> -p 4200
```

> Replace `<project-folder>` with the actual folder produced inside `dist/` (Angular may sanitize special characters).

---

### 6. 🧪 Run tests

```bash
ng test
```

This will execute unit tests via **Karma**.

## 📌 TO DO
  
- Further improvements such as guards, more advanced error handling, and UI enhancements can be added.
- More coherence on graphic design styles and motive.
- Animations between starships-list and starships-details
- Responsive design
- Cleaner code (carousel substitution)
- This README will be updated as the project evolves.
