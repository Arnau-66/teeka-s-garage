# 🌿 Develop Branch – Teeka's Garage

This branch contains the **most up-to-date working version** of the project.  
It is used for **active development**, including new features, fixes, and improvements before they are merged into the `main` branch.

## 🧭 Branch Purpose

- 💻 Implement new functionality and iterate on features.  
- 🧪 Test changes in a development environment.  
- 🔄 Serve as the integration branch for future pull requests.

> ⚠️ Code in this branch may change frequently and might not always be completely stable.

## 📌 Workflow

- New features should be developed in separate `feature/*` branches.  
- Once tested, they are merged into `develop`.  
- Periodically, stable versions from `develop` are merged into `main` for release.
